# Deliverables Automation with Wafermap Visualization

## 📖 Description
Automates semiconductor deliverables by converting CSVs to Excel, generating pivot tables, validating End Test numbers, and creating wafermap visualizations for yield and defect tracking. Built with Python, Tkinter, OpenPyXL, and xlwings, it streamlines workflows and ensures reproducible, audit‑ready insights.

## 🚀 Features
- **CSV → Excel Conversion**  
  Converts raw CSV deliverables into structured Excel workbooks with professional formatting.
- **Pivot Table Generation**  
  Automates fallout analysis by filtering C1_MARK values and calculating End Test fallout percentages.
- **End Test Validation**  
  Locates and validates End Test numbers against reference tables, highlighting limit conditions.
- **Wafermap Visualization**  
  Generates wafermaps with color‑coded grids for yield/defect tracking, mirrored headers, and clean formatting.
- **GUI Interface**  
  Tkinter‑based interface for file selection, filter dropdowns, and status logging.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (automation & GUI)
- **Tkinter** (user interface)
- **OpenPyXL** (Excel file handling)
- **xlwings** (pivot tables & wafermap generation)
- **CSV** (data parsing)
